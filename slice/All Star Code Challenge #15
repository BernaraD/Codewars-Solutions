//This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students

//Your family runs a shop and have just brought a Scrolling Text Machine (http://3.imimg.com/data3/RP/IP/MY-2369478/l-e-d-multicolour-text-board-250x250.jpg) to help get some more business.

//The scroller works by replacing the current text string with a similar text string, but with the first letter shifted to the end; this simulates movement.

//You're father is far too busy with the business to worry about such details, so, naturally, he's making you come up with the text strings.

//Create a function named rotate() that accepts a string argument and returns an array of strings with each letter from the input string being rotated to the end.

//rotate("Hello") // => ["elloH", "lloHe", "loHel", "oHell", "Hello"

function rotate(str){
 let newArr = []
  let currentStr = str;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++){
    let newCurrentStr = currentStr.slice(1) + currentStr[0]
    newArr.push(newCurrentStr)
    currentStr = newCurrentStr
  }
  return newArr
}
