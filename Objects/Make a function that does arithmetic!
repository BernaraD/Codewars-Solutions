//Given two numbers and an arithmetic operator (the name of it, as a string), return the result of the two numbers having that operator used on them.

//a and b will both be positive integers, and a will always be the first number in the operation, and b always the second.

//The four operators are "add", "subtract", "divide", "multiply".

//A few examples:

//arithmetic(5, 2, "add")      => returns 7
//arithmetic(5, 2, "subtract") => returns 3
//arithmetic(5, 2, "multiply") => returns 10
//arithmetic(5, 2, "divide")   => returns 2.
