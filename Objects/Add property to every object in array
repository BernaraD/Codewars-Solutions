//Your task is to add a new property usersAnswer to every object in the array questions. The value of usersAnswer should be set to null. The solution should work for array of any length.

//For example:

var questions = [{
    question: "What's the currency of the USA?",
    choices: ["US dollar", "Ruble", "Horses", "Gold"],
    corAnswer: 0
}, {
    question: "Where was the American Declaration of Independence signed?",
    choices: ["Philadelphia", "At the bottom", "Frankie's Pub", "China"],
    corAnswer: 0
}];
After adding the property the result should be:

var questions = [{
    question: "What's the currency of the USA?",
    choices: ["US dollar", "Ruble", "Horses", "Gold"],
    corAnswer: 0,
    usersAnswer: null
}, {
    question: "Where was the American Declaration of Independence signed?",
    choices: ["Philadelphia", "At the bottom", "Frankie's pub", "China"],
    corAnswer: 0,
    usersAnswer: null
}];


Solution 1:
questions.forEach(function (i) {
        i.usersAnswer = null;
    });
  
  
Solution 2:
for (key in questions)
  questions[key].usersAnswer = null;
