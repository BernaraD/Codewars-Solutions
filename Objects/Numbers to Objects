You will be given an array of numbers.

For each number in the array you will need to create an object.

The object key will be the number, as a string. The value will be the corresponding character code, as a string.

Return an array of the resulting objects.

All inputs will be arrays of numbers. All character codes are valid lower case letters. The input array will not be empty.


Solution 1:

function numObj(s){
  return s.map(el => {
    const obj = {};
    obj[el] = String.fromCharCode(el);
    return obj;
  });
}
