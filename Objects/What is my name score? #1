The 26 letters of the English alphabets are randomly divided into 5 groups of 5 letters with the remaining letter being ignored. Each of the group is assigned a score of more than 0. The ignored letter always has a score of 0.

With this kata, write a function nameScore(name) to work out the score of a name that is passed to the function.

The output should be returned as an object:

{'Mary Jane':20}
Only letters have a score. Spaces do not.

You can safely assume that name does not contain any punctuations or symbols. There will also be no empty string or null value.

A static alpha object for testing has been preloaded for your convenience in the following format:

{'ABCDE':1,'FGHIJ':2,'KLMNO':3,'PQRST':4,'UVWXY':5}  //'Z' is ignored
Note that the alpha object will be randomly generated each time you run the test.


function nameScore(name){
  let arr = name.toUpperCase().split('')
  let score = 0
  for(el of arr)
    for(key in alpha)
      if(key.includes(el)) {
        score += alpha[key]
        }
  return { [name]: score }
}
