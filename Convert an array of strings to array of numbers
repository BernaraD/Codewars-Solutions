//Some really funny web dev gave you an array of numbers from his API response as an array of strings!

//You need to cast the whole array to the correct type.

//Create the function

//JavaScript: toNumberArray(array)
//Ruby: toNumberArray(array)

//that takes as a parameter an array of numbers represented as strings and outputs an array of numbers.

//ie:["1", "2", "3"] to [1, 2, 3]

//Note that you can receive floats as well.

function toNumberArray(stringarray){
  
  return stringarray.map(Number);
}
